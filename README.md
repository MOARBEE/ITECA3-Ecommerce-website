# ITECA3-Ecommerce-website
So this was the major assignment for ITECA3, we had to make an e commerce website. The website i made was a car website, for Hamz Auto, Mohammed Hoosen. Basically the website has a home page, cars for sales page, about page and a contact us page. Also it is connected to a database, i will add the database information in this file. I had to use a add to cart option and make sure that it is compatible with paypal, which i did, it was for the project, obviously this wouldnt work in an actual car dealership website but i did it for the marks. Had to make a paypal account and a sandbox account as well as add Hamz Auto as a Rest API by my apps and credentials on the paypal developer/sandbox account. Ive added as much pictures of the website as possible, this website could definitely be used as a production level website. The databases were created using xampp and phpmyadmin. The actual coding file was too big so i had to zip it. This website supports Desktop, mobile and mostly tablet (not 100% though). Remember in order to use the code to its full potential, it has to be in the Xampp folder, in the htdocs folder.
